## Hi there üëã
My name is Haojun Jiang(ËíãÊòäÂ≥ª) [[My Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ULmStp8AAAAJ&hl=en)], a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Gao Huang](http://www.gaohuang.net/). Before that, I received my B.E. degree in Automation at Tsinghua University. üòÑ

Beginning in May (2023), I will be shifting my focus to the research of medical embodied robotic system. **_Recently, the intelligent [carotid ultrasound robot project](https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/UltraBot) I led was accepted by Nature Communications!_** 

_**I am expected to graduate in June 2026 and am currently exploring future opportunities. If you are interested in my research, please do not hesitate to contact me (Email: jianghaojunthu at 163.com).**_
